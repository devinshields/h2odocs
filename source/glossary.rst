   categorical

        a qualitative variable (for example: blood type)

   cloud

        (Synonym for cluster.)  See definition of cluster 

   cluster

        (Synonym for cloud.)  A group of H2O nodes that work together;
        when a job is submitted to a cluster, all the nodes in the
        cluster work on a portion of the job

        in statistics: a cluster is a group of observations from a
	data set that have been identified as similiar according to a
	particular clustering algorithm

   continuous 
	
	a variable that can take on all or nearly all values 

   CSV file

       CSV is an acronym for comma separated value. A CSV file stores
       data in a plain text format 

   Destination Key   
	
	Automatically generated key for a model; it allows recall of a
	specific model later in analysis. Users can specify a
	different destination key than the key generated by H2O. 

   DKV

        Distributed key/value store; see key/value store

   family

	In GLM family describes the options available for predictive
	modeling in GLM. Also see gaussian, poisson, gamma, binomial
   	
   feature

        Synonym for attribute, predictor, and independent variable

   GZ (gzipped) file

        gzip is a type of file compression, a gzipped file is a file

   HEX format

        Records made up of hexadecimal numbers that represent machine
	language code or constant data  

   job

        A piece of work that needs to be done. For example, reading
        in a data file, parsing a data file, or building a model

   key
	The .hex key generated when you parsed your data into
	H2O. "Key" is an input on each page where users define models  

   key/value pair

        A type of data that associates a particular key index to a
	certain datum  

   key/value store

        A tool that allows storage of schema-less data. Data usually
	consists of a string which represents the key, and the data
	which is the value 

   link 

 	A user defined option in GLM. See the GLM user guide for
	further detail 

   n-folds 

	User defined number of cross validation models generated by H2O

 
   node

        In distributed computing systems nodes include clients,
	servers or peers 
	
	In statistics a node is a decision or terminal point in a
	classification tree

   parse

        Analysis of a string of symbols or datum resulting in the
	conversion of a set of information from a person-readable
	format to a machine-readable format

   seed

        A starting point for randomization

   standardization
   
        stuff

   XLS file

        A Microsoft Excel 2003 - 2007 spreadsheet file format 

   Y
	Dependent variable used in GLM; a user defined input selected
	from the set of variables present in the user's data
