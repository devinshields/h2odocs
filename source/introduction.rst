Introduction
============

H2O by 0xdata brings better algorithms to big data. H2O is the open
source math & machine learning platform for speed and scale. With H2O,
enterprises can use all of their data (instead of sampling) in
real-time for better predictions. Data Scientists can take both simple
& sophisticated models to production from the same interactive
platform used for modeling, within R and JSON. H2O is also used as an
algorithms library for Making Hadoop Do Math. Our earliest customers
have built powerful domain specific predictive engines for
Recommendations, Pricing and Outlier detection in Fraud &
Insurance. 0xdata is the maker of H2O and nurturing a grassroots
movement of math, systems and data science to herald the new wave of
Discovery with Big Data 
Science.

Here's an presentation of H2O:
