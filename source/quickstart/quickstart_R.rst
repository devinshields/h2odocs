Using H2O through R (Easy Start from Download)
----------------------------------------------

From the R Console
""""""""""""""""""

These instructions assume you are using a recent version of R, and are familiar with the basics of using command line. 

The download package can be obtained by clicking on the button **Download H2O Jar** at 

::

  http://0xdata.com/h2O/

Once the download completes, move the downloaded file to the desktop. 

*Users should be aware that in order for H2O to successfully run through R, an instance of H2O must also simultaneously be running. If the instance of H2O is stopped, the R program will no longer run, and work done will be lost.* 

These instructions first address running H2O, and then running H2O through R. 

Open the command line terminal. Mac and Windows users not familiar with command line may find this article helpful:

At the terminal prompt enter the following commands:

::

  $cd Desktop/h2o-.../ #change directory to the h2o file. Note that "h2o…" should be   completed with the full h2o file name for the file you downloaded. The file number may   change to indicate a more recent version of H2O. 
  $ java -Xmx3g -jar h2o.jar -name mystats-cloud   # starts an instance of H2O. 

This returns output like the following:

::

**Minimize** the terminal window, and open R. 

In the R console install the library by entering the following command at the prompt:

::

  >install.packages("/Users/UserName/Desktop/h2o file name/R/ **tar.gz file name**", repos = NULL, type = "source")
  


**To find the tar.gz file name**, go to h2o file ==> R, and find the file with the extension ".tar.gz."  


For example, a user at 0x data enters the following into her R console at the command prompt:

::

  >install.packages("/Users/Irene/Desktop/h2o-1.5.6137/R/h2o_1.5.6.137.tar.gz", repos = NULL, 
  type = "source")

Which returns the following output

::

  * installing *source* package ‘h2o’ ...
  ** R
  ** demo
  ** inst
  ** preparing package for lazy loading
  Creating a generic function for ‘colnames’ from package ‘base’ in package ‘h2o’
  Creating a generic function for ‘nrow’ from package ‘base’ in package ‘h2o’
  Creating a generic function for ‘ncol’ from package ‘base’ in package ‘h2o’
  Creating a generic function for ‘summary’ from package ‘base’ in package ‘h2o’

  ** help
  *** installing help indices
  ** building package indices
  ** testing if installed package can be loaded
  * DONE (h2o)
 

**R Studio users** can install the H2O package by finding the tabbed menu "File; Plots; Packages; Help" and choosing *Packages*. Clicking on *Install Packages* brings up an installation helper. Choose *Package Archive File (tgz; .tar.gz)* in the *"Install From"* field. Click browse and follow the helper to specify Desktop ==> h2o file ==> R ==> .tar.gz file. *Click "Open". Click "Install"*


All R users (both console and R Studio) Enter the command 

::

  > require(h2o)

which returns the following output

::

  Loading required package: h2o
  Loading required package: RCurl
  Loading required package: bitops
  Loading required package: rjson

In the R terminal enter

::

  > localH2O = new("H2OClient")
  > h2o.checkClient(localH2O)

Which returns the following output

::

  Successfully connected to http://127.0.0.1:54321 

Users can now run H2O from their R console. Additional R documentation can be found here

::

  https://github.com/0xdata/h2o/blob/master/R/h2o-package/h2o_package.pdf   


Users can now run H2O from their R Studio console. Additional R documentation can be found in the R section of the main user documentation page. Users can also enter **??h2o** at any time to access help. 


**Users can change the amount of memory allocated to H2O.** In the Java command entered in the terminal to start H2O the term **-Xmx2g** was used. Xmx is the amount of memory given to H2O. If your data set is large, give H2O more memory (for example, -Xmx4g gives H2O four gigabytes of memory). For best performance, Xmx should be 4x the size of your data, but never more than the total amount of memory on your computer.
