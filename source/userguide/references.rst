Prior publications and useful reading relevant to analysis in general
and for each algorithm can be found at the references listed below. 

Understanding the algorithms of H2O is an integral part of using the
platform correctly, and getting the most of analysis. 

Below are the citations of seminal articles, and articles
demonstrating rigorous application of the algorithms of H2O. Included
are referencesfor algos currently in the works. This list is not meant
to be exhaustive, but ratherto provide an abbreviated syllabus to help
develop a strong understanding.
